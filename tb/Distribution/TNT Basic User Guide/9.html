			<p><b>The Short Version</b><br>
				We've worked really hard to ensure TNT Basic and Hieroglyph are bug free and as stable as possible; however, if either of them suddenly go wrong and they wipe your disk/blow up your computer/trigger an apocalypse we cannot be held responsible.</p>
			<p>If you do find any bugs or things which don't seem right, please please please let us know through the <a href="../community/forums/index.php">community forums</a> or TNT Basic's <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=135906&atid=734239">bug tracker</a>. It would help us even more if you could use the bug reporting scripts that are part of the TNT Basic distribution.</p>
			<p>Remember, you are using TNT Basic and Hieroglyph at your own risk - repeat after me &quot;The authors are not responsible if TNT Basic or Hieroglyph do bad things to your computer&quot;.</p>
			<p>Sorry we had to rub this in your faces, it's the world we live in.</p>
