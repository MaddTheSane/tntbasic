					<h2>Welcome To Bang On!</h2>
					<div align="left">
						<p><b>MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO WHEN THE EARTH WAS NEW........</b></p>
						<p>...there lived a race of little green blobs. These were the first life forms graced with intelligence and they are the reason life remained possible at all....</p>
					</div>
					<div align="center">
						<p><img src="gfx/little_green_blob.gif" width="37" height="36" border="0"></p>
					</div>
					<div align="left">
						<p>In it's infancy the Earth was an unstable, inhospitable place. Long before the atmosphere could support life as we know it today the Earth's swamps and volcanos would produce bubbles of noxious, suffocating carbon monoxide. Once free, these bubbles would roam the earth destroying everything in their path. Life on Earth was coming to an end!!</p>
						<p>The little green blobs, however, had a plan. They could easily neutralise small bubbles and turn them into harmless carbon dioxide, however, some of the bubbles were too large for their technology, so they needed to be broken down first. The little green blobs now knew that one of them was going to have to face these bubbles. What they needed was a hero....</p>
						<h2>Controlling the Little Green Blob</h2>
						<p>Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to control the little green blob.</p>
						<p>The left and right arrow keys move the little green blob left and right respectively, and the up arrow key makes the little green blob jump. Space makes the little green blob fire it's currently active weapon.</p>
						<p>Be careful though, if the little green blob comes into contact with a bubble then it will be killed!</p>
						<p><b>Good Luck!</b></p>
						<h2>Power-Ups</h2>
						<p>There are three power-ups available in Bang On! and they are all concerned with weapons.</p>
						<p><img src="gfx/twin_lasers.gif" width="19" height="19" border="0" align="absmiddle"> <b>Twin Lasers</b></p>
						<p>Very fast firing but does not leave a trail behind. It will disappear i it hits a brick or the top of the screen. This is very good for doing lots of damage to bubbles very quickly but can be difficult to use on low altitude bubbles.</p>
						<p><img src="gfx/spiral_powerup.gif" width="19" height="19" border="0" align="absmiddle"> <b>Spirals</b></p>
						<p>Moves slowly upwards and leaves a trail behind that damages bubbles. Up to three can be active at the same time, but if it hits the top of the screen or a brick then it will disappear. A good all round weapon.</p>
						<p><img src="gfx/grappling_hook.gif" width="19" height="20" border="0" align="absmiddle"> <b>Grappling Hook</b></p>
						<p>Moves slowly up the screen and leaves a trail behind that damages bubbles. If this hits the top of the screen or a brick then itstops and stays there for a while or until a bubble hits it. Three can be active at the same time but because these stay around for a long time this can sometimes mean you are unable to fire. Still, this is very useful if you are stuck in a tight corner.</p>
