        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva,Arial">The screen has only one
        canvas attached to it. This is canvas number 0 and all drawing
        operations in this canvas are applied to the screen.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva,Arial">Other canvases can be
        opened and drawing operations can be performed in them. Drawing
        can be performed in one of these 'invisible' canvases and then
        copied to the screen.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva,Arial">The reason for doing this
        is that images can be built without the user having any knowledge
        of them. They can then be copied to the screen in one move.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva,Arial">Copying the image is probably
        much faster than building it. This means that if the same image
        needs to be drawn to the screen repeatedly it can be stored in
        a background canvas and copied to the screen as often as it is
        needed.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
