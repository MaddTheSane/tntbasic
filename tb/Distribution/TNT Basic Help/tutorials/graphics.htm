</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">All drawing operations
are performed using something called a pen.&nbsp; As the name
suggests, the pen determines what the drawing operation will eventually
look like.&nbsp; The pen has two different values associated with
it, colour and transparency.</FONT></P>

Colour controls the colour of the pen and hence the colour of
the final drawing operation, it can be set by calling the command
<A HREF="../commands/setpencolour.htm">Set Pen Colour</A>.&nbsp;
This takes one parameter, a colour, which is the new colour for
the pen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Colours are built up from three
components: red, green and blue.&nbsp; By mixing different amounts
of these three colours any colour can be produced using the command

it copies all newly drawn graphics to the screen.&nbsp; In order
for it to do this, it needs to have kept track of the areas of
the screen that have changed and, when Draw Frame is called, copy
these areas to the screen so the user can see them.&nbsp; This
process can become quite slow, especially if you are drawing lots
of things to the screen and TNT Basic has to keep track of a lot
of areas.&nbsp; Fortunately though, this process can be accelerated.&nbsp;

operations are all performed off screen where the user can't see
them.&nbsp; They are then copied to the screen in one go so, to
the user, they all appeared at the same time.&nbsp; When these
drawing operations are performed off screen they are drawn into
something called a 'canvas'.&nbsp; A canvas is exactly what it
sounds - a thing that can be drawn on with whatever you like.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva,Helvetica">Ordinarily, drawing
operations are performed into canvas 0, this canvas was created

one canvas to another.</FONT></P>

call the function <A HREF="../commands/opencanvas.htm">Open Canvas</A>...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva,Helvetica">Drawing operations
can be performed into canvas 1 exactly like they were into canvas

1.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva,Helvetica">The contents of canvas
