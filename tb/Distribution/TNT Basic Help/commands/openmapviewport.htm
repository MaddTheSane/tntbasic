        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">This command opens a tile scrolling
        canvas with the effective size of the total map, but an actual
        size of only just a little larger than the viewport. This means
        that as far as you are concerned you have a large canvas to scroll
        around, however, in terms of memory it only opens a small canvas.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">The map used is the currently
        loaded map. If the canvas is open, it is closed and reopened
        to be just larger than the viewport size. This canvas is managed
        by the viewport, you <I>can</I> draw on the canvas yourself,
        but your changes will just be erased whenever you scroll enough
        for the map to be redrawn.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">If you change the tiles on the
        map with the 'set map tile' command then the tiles will be updated
        in the viewport. If you change the currently loaded map then
        the viewport will redraw with the new map.</FONT></P>

        When doing tile scrolling, you open a canvas just a<BR>
        little larger than the viewport and then scroll only by a few
        pixels before resetting the scroll back to zero and redrawing
        the map tiles 1 tile over. This allows a huge map to be scrolled
        without having to open a canvas as big as the map.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Using a map viewport is a lot
        easier than doing tile scrolling yourself, TNT Basic takes care
        of all the map redrawing and scrolling offset for you, you just
        treat the canvas as a huge canvas the size of the map. You can
        position your sprites anywhere on the map without having to worry
        about doing the same coordinate transforms you'd have to perform
        if doing manual tile scrolling.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">The viewport can be removed
        from the display with the function <A HREF="closeviewport.htm">Close
        Viewport</A> and scrolled using <A HREF="setviewportoffset.htm">Set
        Viewport Offset</A>.</FONT>
