Quick notes on doing a TB release build:
Mark Tully
31/1/06

* check you've updated the version history in the user guide
* check you've bump rerevved tb, tb browser & glyph
* cd into tb HelpSource and run formathelp.pl to make the help docs
* cd into the TNT Basic Help directory in the Distribution directory and run "find . -name '*.htm' -exec 'SetFile' '-t' 'TEXT' {} ';'" to make all files into TEXT files, this is necessary for the OS 9 help indexer to work. Do the same in the TNT Basic User Guide dir, execept for .html files rather than .htm files
* Create new dir
* Copy in glyph, tb, glyph blocks, examples, bug reporting tool (OS X + 9), User Guide + Commands Help alias files, User Guide, Help
* Remove all CVS dirs
* Remove templates not related to TB from Hieroglyph blocks
* Copy and paste nice icons onto Hieroglyph Blocks and its sub dirs
* Tidy up release window
* You can paste TNT Basic Help/gfx/toc_whole.jpg in for the window background using the view options if you want
* Index the help using the OS 9 indexing tool (see help notes document)
* Boot into OS 9, tidy up the icons, check it runs etc. also change the creator code of the target of the two aliases (user guide + commands help) so they open in IE
* ensure you're all committed to cvs
* tag the db, 'cvs tag release_1_3_1'
