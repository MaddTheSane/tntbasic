TNT Basic To Do List
--------------------
	
¥ Overflow protection

¥ Optimisers - look for expressions which are flagged as constant and replace with a constant

¥ Stop Gotos from jumping into for loops

¥ Error messages in TNT Basic.rsrc all have a different tense. Some say what has happened ("Arithmetic Overflow") others
  say what's gone wrong ("The set creator function has not been called..."). Read over them all together and decided on a
  tense. Also add parameterised messages

¥ Stop sparks using CProgram class, it can't be a generic TNT Engine if it's tied to TNT Basic can it
  Suggest creating an abstract CPauseResume class such:
  	class CPauseResume
  	{
  		protected:
  			bool		mPaused;
  		public:
  						CPauseResume() : mPaused(false) {}
  			virtual void /*e*/ Pause() = 0L;
  			virtual void /*e*/ Resume() = 0L;
  			virtual bool IsPaused() { return mPaused; }
  	}
  Mix this in with the program and make sparks take a ptr to a CPauseResume object instead of a CProgram object, then it will
  be TNT Basic indepedent
¥ Weird scoping rules
	if 0
		int x
	end if
	x=1
	
	is valid. Perhaps if statements should have their own scopes too?
	
	Can declare procedures inside if statements etc..
