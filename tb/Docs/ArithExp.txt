Arithmetic Expressions in TNT Basic

Premise
-------
An arithmetic expression is either an integer or a float. The idea is to allow the user to use the two interchangably. If
the situation demands an int and a float is passed then it should be automatically coerced. If the same value is passed to
a context where a float is needed then the accuracy of the float should not be lost.

Structure
---------
CArithExpession is a class which can either be a float or an int. It has two evaluate functions, EvaluateInt and
EvaluateFloat. The one called depends on the context of the code using the arithexpression.
A sub expression will override either EvaluateInt or EvaluateFloat. If EvalauteFloat is overridden then CArithExpression::mIsFloat
MUST be set to true. This can be done by passing true to CArithExpression's constructor.

EvaluateInt will automatically convert the results of EvaluateFloat if mIsFloat is set to true.
EvaluateFloat will automatically convert the results of EvaluateInt if mIsFloat is set to false.

Arithmetic
----------
When operating a float to an int the results is an float. This follows C's rule of returning the largest data type.
