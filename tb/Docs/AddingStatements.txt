Adding a statement to TNT Basic
-------------------------------

1. Add a rule to the lexer, make the action be Return_Statement(tokenId);
   You should not need to modify the parser.

2. In the UFunctionMgr::MakeStatement add a case for the tokenId you're adding.
   Make it create the statement and assign it to result.
   The general expression list passed to makestatement is a list of the parameters passed to
   the statement. They can be either nums or strs and the seperators can be either ,;to   
   
   Your statement constructor is free to throw exceptions (make sure it cleans up proper before
   throwing).
   It should ensure the parameter list is valid for its purposes, if not then it should
   throw an exception reporting the error by using the UTBException class. The error will
   be logged and parsing will continue.
   Alternately you can check the parameters before passing them to your constructor.
   If your statement doesn't accept parameters then you should throw if parameters are passed.
   
   IMPORTANT: If the constructor throws an exception it MUST NOT delete the expression list
   inputted to it, it should only adopt this list if it constructs successfully.
