help viewer notes

the commands listing is contained in the auto-generated file 'toc.htm'

on os 9 this is stored in the help folder
on ox x this is stored in the user's cache folder, in side com.apple.helpviewer/tnt basic help

on os x, the code to generate the toc listing seems to be broken (it only ever contains Abs)
the problem is, this broken toc.htm in the cache folder, overrides any valid one that might
exist in the help folder, which means that you can't actually get an index.
if you delete it from the cache and delete the template file that generates the toc from
the tb help folder, then it will use the toc.htm that's there and work.

in order to avoid this, before distributing, delete the toctmpl.htm file, this will stop
the index being regenerated. move the toc.htm (a good up-to-date version) into a sub dir
toc/toc.htm.
Relink the link in inittoc.htm.
Relink all resources refered to from toc/toc.htm.

When making the indexes. Previously I've used the Mac OS 9 Help Indexer from Apple Help SDK 1.0. You need to change all the OS 9 file types to TEXT otherwise it will skip the file and it won't be indexed (no warnings)

It doesn't matter whether the line endings are Mac or Unix as far as I can tell.

The OS X help indexer seems to exit if you try and produce old style help indexes. And the new Tiger style ones don't seem to work (as in they get no hits)

Thinking about it, I'm pretty sure I could just auto generate this listing with formathelp.pl....
