Some of the docs in this directory are very old. Most were notes I made during TB's development and
contain ideas that were either implemented, discarded or are still on my 'todo list' :)

All of them should be taken with a pinch of salt regarding their accuracy, often the doc was written
before the code, then the code would follow and improve upon the design outlined in the doc. The
code is the only true place to find out how things work!
