Arrays in TNT Basic

Arrays in TNT basic are currently the most complex data type. The implementation revolves around three classes. The first is
the array symbol itself. This symbol entry retrieves an array storage class from the current stack frame. An array storage
class is an actual array of the data type required and is where all the values are stored. The third and final class is
the item reference class. This references a single item in the array. Each item reference is stored in the array symbol
allowing them to be deleted when the array symbol is deleted.

ArraySymbol		: Maps name onto an ArrayStore
ArrayStore		: Holds a list of values
ItemReference	: References an item in an ArrayStore
