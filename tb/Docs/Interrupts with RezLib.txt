Interrupting cow
----------------

Since we moved to RezLib, our interrupts have never been as accurate under OS 9. When the
displays running at x Hz, our vbl proc tends to be called at x-10 Hz. This is a bit annoying
but I can't really see anything we can do about it.

The previous version used a dsp call, I don't know how dsp did it under the hood, but RezLib
uses SlotVInstall, which is clearly wanting...

To test the VBL timing in TNT Basic, set the CheckVBLTimer macro to true in CGraphicsContext16.h
then see the results output in bkg console when the context is deleted.
