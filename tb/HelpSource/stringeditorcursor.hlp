The string editor allows you to take key presses from the user and use them to edit a string of text in a similar manner to a word processor. An overview of the string editor can be found in the @@String Editor@@ section of the @@Keyboard Input Guide@@.

This command returns the index into the string editor contents of the text insertion point where newly typed characters will appear. On the Macintosh, it is usually represented by a flashing vertical bar.

A cursor index of 0 means at the beginning of the string, 1 is after the first character, 2 is after the second and so on. The index will therefore range from 0 to:

<tnt>String Length (String Editor Contents)</tnt>
...inclusive.

You can set the cursor position with @@Set String Editor Cursor@@.
