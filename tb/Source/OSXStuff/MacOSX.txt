Note on OS X icon
-----------------

It was made by IconComposer from the Mac OS X tool cd-rom. It came from
Barrel Icon Final.png in the Cinema 4D/TNT Barrel/Finals folder on Durandal.

IconComposer saved it in the data fork, but I used resourcer to copy the DF into
an icns resource.

The plist file contains stuff os x needs to know about tb, it has to be copied into
plst resource 0. It allows tb to have a nice icon and have drag and drop support
