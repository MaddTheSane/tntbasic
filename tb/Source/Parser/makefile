# since the flex/bison plug-ins don't work with cw under x we need alternate arrangements
# mac os x comes with bison and flex built in so we can run them from the command line
# this make file builds the parsers and lexers from the respective yacc and lex files for
# both the basic parser and the preprocessor.

# usage:
# make
#		makes target 'allparsers' which is the flex and yacc files for both the basic parser
#		and the preprocessor

allparsers:	basic.tab.c lex.basic.c preprocessor.tab.c lex.preprocessor.c

clean:
		rm basic.tab.c preprocessor.tab.c lex.basic.c lex.preprocessor.c

# preprocessor.tab.c lex.basic.c lex.preprocessor.c

basic.tab.c : basic.y
	bison --file-prefix=basic --name-prefix=basic --defines basic.y

# make the basic lexer, this includes basic.tab.h, generated by the basic.tab.c target; hence
# basic.tab.c is listed as a dependancy
lex.basic.c : basic.l basic.tab.c
	flex -8i -Pbasic basic.l
	
preprocessor.tab.c : preprocessor.y
	bison --file-prefix=preprocessor --name-prefix=preprocessor --defines preprocessor.y
#	bison --debug --file-prefix=preprocessor --name-prefix=preprocessor --defines preprocessor.yacc

lex.preprocessor.c : preprocessor.l lex.basic.c preprocessor.tab.c
	flex -8i -Ppreprocessor preprocessor.l
