Build requirements
------------------
You need to use Xcode 3 to compile TNT Basic (eg Xcode 3.2.6). It won't compile in Xcode 4 as it refernces APIs which
Apple have finally killed off with Xcode 4. It is possible to install Xcode 3 on OS X Lion, you just need to hack around
with the Xcode installer - instructions are only a google away.

Support for Xcode 4 will be added as soon as possible.

Building the help
-----------------
A lot of the documentation is stored in HTML inside 'tb/Distribution/TNT Basic Help'. However, a move is being
made to the more flexible .hlp files, which are stored in 'tb/Help Source'. If you change any HTML based
documentation, please consider moving it to the more modern .hlp file at the same time. It doesn't take long
to do.
To build the HTML documentation from the .hlp files, open a terminal, cd into tb/HelpSource and type:
'formathelp.pl -t', this will build a commands index of all the commands that are currently documented, it will
then use this commands index to automatically hyperlink the documentation. You only need to do this command rarely,
read the comments at the top of the formathelp.pl for more information.
Next type 'formathelp.pl' this will convert all .hlp files to HTML using the tbformat tool built at step 3 to
format any TNT Basic source code into HTML. Currently, formathelp.pl only converts to HTML.
