The music library consists of two parts: the UTNTMusicManager class and the CMusicDriver
abstract class.

Essentially the the UTNTMusicManager is called to upon to load, play, access and otherwise
process music. In turn it makes use of abstract music drivers that can play music of different
formats.

So far there are two drivers, a tracker driver for playing MODs etc: CMikModDriver and CMODDriver
and a QT driver that plays MP3s CQTMusicDriver.

CMADDriver is more complete than CMikModDriver. I abandoned CMikModDriver cos it was lo
quality sound and it was difficult to support functions for getting length of the music and
getting/setting the play head position.

Basically, just add CMADDriver and CQTMusicDriver to the project and forget about them. Do
all the work through CTNTMusicManager and you'll be fine.
