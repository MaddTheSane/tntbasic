Using the Broadcast and Listener classes
----------------------------------------

What do they do?
----------------
Essensially they offer a means of communication between objects. When a broadcaster broadcasts a message, all listeners which
have been added to it receive the message.

Example use
-----------
What this means is that you can be real cunning in the way you implement things. You can put a broadcaster in an object
and when that object is deleted, all listeners are informed.

You can also use the TSafePointer object which holds a pointer and returns 0L if the pointer was deallocated.
Just create one with TSafePointer<T> (where T is the type of pointer) and pass params (broadcaster,pointer). If the
broadcaster dies then the pointer is set to 0L, simple.
